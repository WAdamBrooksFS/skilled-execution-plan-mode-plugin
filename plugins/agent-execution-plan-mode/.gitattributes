# Enforce line endings for shell scripts and PowerShell scripts
# This ensures scripts work correctly on all platforms

# Bash/shell scripts must use LF (Unix-style) line endings
*.sh text eol=lf

# PowerShell scripts use CRLF (Windows-style) line endings
*.ps1 text eol=crlf

# JSON files use LF for consistency
*.json text eol=lf

# Markdown files use LF for consistency
*.md text eol=lf
